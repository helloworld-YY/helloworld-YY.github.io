I'm currently a first-year doctoral student in the College of Computer Science and Technology at <a href ="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/">Zhejiang University></a>. Before this, I received my M.S. and B.E. degrees from the School of Information Science and Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2020 and 2016, respectively.

My research topics are affective computing, gaze estimation, gaze-based HCI, and computer vision.
